Let's get this GitHub thing started!

Hi future Gabriel! Today is Sunday, April 15, 2018. I'm sitting at the first floor of Butler Library with Tha√≠s. Earlier today I cooked sweet potatoes, scrambled eggs and bacon for brunch. I'm drinking a Dunkin' Donuts Mocca swirl coffee and I should be job hunting instead of starting this. Hope you're doing fine! :)
